'''Your job is to go through the lists of data that 
have been collected in the past couple of weeks. 
You will be calculating some important metrics 
that you can use to plan out the operation of 
the business for the rest of the month.

You have been provided with three lists:

    
    hairstyles: the names of the cuts offered

    prices: the price of each hairstyle in the hairstyles list

    last_week: the number of each hairstyle in hairstyles that was purchased last week'''



hairstyles = ["bouffant", "pixie", "dreadlocks",
              "crew", "bowl", "bob", "mohawk", "flattop"]

prices = [30, 25, 40, 20, 20, 35, 50, 35]

last_week = [2, 3, 5, 8, 4, 4, 6, 2]


total_price = 0

#Iterate through the prices list and add each price to the variable total_price.

for price in prices:
  total_price += price

#After your loop, create a variable called average_price that is the total_price divided by
#the number of prices.  You can get the number of prices by using the len() function.

average_price = total_price / len(prices)

#Print the value of average_price so the output looks like:
#Average Haircut Price:
#<average_price>

print("Average Price: ${0}".format(average_price))

#That average price is more expensive than Carly thought it would be! She wants to cut all
#prices by 5 dollars.  Use a list comprehension to make a list called new_prices, which has each element in prices minus 5.

new_prices = [price - 5 for price in prices]
print(new_prices)


#Create a variable called total_revenue and set it to 0.

total_revenue = 0

#Use a for loop to create a variable i that goes from 0 to len(hairstyles) Hint: You can use range() to do this!

for i in range(len(hairstyles)):
  #Add the product of prices[i] (the price of the haircut at position i) and last_week[i] (the number of people
  #who got the haircut at position i) to total_revenue at each step.

    total_revenue += prices[i] * last_week[i]

    #After your loop, print the value of total_revenue, so the output looks like:
    #Total Revenue: <total_revenue>

    print("Total Revenue: ${0}".format(total_revenue))

    #Find the average daily revenue by dividing total_revenue by 7. Call this number
    #average_daily_revenue and print it out.

    average_daily_revenue=total_revenue / 7
    print("Average daily revenue: ${0}".format(average_price))


    cuts_under_30=[hairstyles[i]
    for i in range(len(hairstyles)) if new_prices[i] < 30]

    print(cuts_under_30)
